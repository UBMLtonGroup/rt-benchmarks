running "fibonacci.erl" generates "fibonacci.csv" //
running "gcBench.erl" generates "GCBench.csv" //
running "gcBench_fib.erl" generates "GCBench_Fib.csv" //

As long as those three files are in the directory,
if you run "data_parsing.py", it will generate "data.txt"
which summurizes the datasets from those three csv files.
